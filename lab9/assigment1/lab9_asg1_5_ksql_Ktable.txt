1. Considering the readings topic is already created
	readings --> partitions 6

2. Produce some events into readings  topic
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-1', 45, 'wheel');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-2', 41, 'motor');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-1', 42, 'wheel');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-3', 42, 'muffler');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-3', 48, 'muffler');

3. Create KTable:
CREATE TABLE avg_readings AS 
	SELECT sensor, AVG(val) as avg 
	FROM readings
	GROUP BY sensor
	EMIT CHANGES;

CREATE TABLE part_avg AS 
	SELECT location, AVG(val) as avg 
	FROM readings
	GROUP BY location
	EMIT CHANGES;
