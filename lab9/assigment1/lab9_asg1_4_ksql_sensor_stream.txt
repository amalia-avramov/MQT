1. Create topic:
	readings --> partitions 6

2. create stream for topic readings
CREATE STREAM readings  (
  sensor VARCHAR KEY, 
  val DOUBLE, 
  location VARCHAR) WITH (
    kafka_topic='readings', 
    partitions=6, 
    value_format='JSON');

3. Produce some events into readings  topic
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-1', 45, 'wheel');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-2', 41, 'motor');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-1', 42, 'wheel');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-3', 42, 'muffler');
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-3', 48, 'muffler');

4. Run some queries
CREATE STREAM clean AS SELECT sensor, val, UCASE(location) as location FROM readings EMIT CHANGES;

SELECT sensor, val, location FROM readings WHERE sensor='sensor-1'  EMIT CHANGES;

CREATE STREAM high_readings AS SELECT sensor, val, location FROM clean where val > 42 EMIT CHANGES;

5. Produce some events into readings  topic
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, val, location) VALUES ('sensor-3', 36, 'motor');
..

6.  Run some queries
CREATE STREAM high_pri AS SELECT sensor, val, UCASE(location) as location 
FROM readings where val > 42 EMIT CHANGES;

CREATE STREAM by_location AS SELECT * FROM high_pri 
PARTITION BY location EMIT CHANGES;

CREATE STREAM by_val AS SELECT * FROM high_pri 
PARTITION BY val EMIT CHANGES;
